  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This project was inspired by my own experience when i was councling my
    patients and i found out that most of them are not able to express their
    feelings and emotions. I realized that many people struggle to articulate
    their thoughts and feelings, which can lead to a sense of isolation and
    disconnection from themselves and others. Hence, the need for journaling is
    as much important as the need for therapy. Journaling can be a powerful tool
    for self-expression, self-discovery, and emotional healing. It can help us
    make sense of our experiences, process our emotions, and gain clarity and
    insight into our inner world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I always wanted to create a software where i can help save many patients
    before it gets worse and thanks to This project, a portfolio piece for my
    time at
    <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX School</a>, where
    I've been honing my skills as a full-stack developer. it enabled me to
    achieve my dreams so in 2024, I set out to create a digital journaling
    platform that would empower others to find their voice, explore their
    emotions, and cultivate greater self-awareness.
