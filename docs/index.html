  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This project was inspired by my own personal journey through journaling and
    self-reflection. After years of struggling to maintain a consistent
    journaling habit, I realized that the traditional pen-and-paper approach
    just wasn't working for me. I yearned for a more seamless, digital
    experience that could integrate with my busy lifestyle and adapt to my
    changing needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, in 2023, I set out to create a digital journaling platform that would
    empower others to find their voice, explore their emotions, and cultivate
    greater self-awareness. This project is a portfolio piece for my time at
    Holberton School, where I've been honing my skills as a full-stack
    developer.
